# Noughts and Crosses
A project for the lecture ‘R for life’ taught at the Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czechia

A classical game Noughts and Crosses made as an R-package.

## Installation of the Package
You can find all the package files in the folder called ‘NaC’. The best way to run the package is by using Rstudio. (You can download it from: https://www.rstudio.com/)

## How to Learn How to Play a Game?
After installing and running the package, you can use the function ‘rules’ to learn all the necessary information to play the game.

## Structure of the Folders
The whole package is located in the folder ‘NaC’. In the folder ‘NaC’, there are folders called ‘R’ (that contains the code of the function), ‘man’ (that contains help files) and ‘inst’ (that contains a citation file).

## Code Structure and Its Modification
The code of the game is written in a way to be easy to modify. The code that determines the answer of the computer is written in ‘modules’ that can be removed (the computer will not be able to solve a problem defined in the removed ‘module’) to decrease the difficulty of the game.
