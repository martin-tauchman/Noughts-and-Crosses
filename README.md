# Noughts-and-Crosses
A project for the lecture ‘R for life’ taught at the Faculty of Science, Charles University, Prague, Czechia

A classical game Noughts and Crosses made as an R-package. You can find all the package files in the folder called ‘NaC’.

After installing and running the package, you can use the function ‘rules’ to learn all the necessary information to play the game.

The code of the game is written in a way to be easy to modify. Therefore, there are checkpoints in the code that finds errors that could be done by wrong code editing. The code that determines the answer of the computer is written in ‘modules’ that can be removed (the computer will not be able to solve a problem defined in the removed ‘module’).

The difficulty of the game can be decreased by removing parts of the code (as described in the previous paragraph) that are responsible for the more complex answer of the computer.
